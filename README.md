## Features

- **Header**: Includes a search bar, voice search, and user icons for notifications and uploads.
- **Sidebar**: Provides navigation links for Home, Explore, Subscriptions, Library, and more.
- **Video Grid**: Displays video previews with thumbnails, titles, authors, and view counts.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensures the layout is user-friendly across various screen sizes.
